<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Mark Olachea and I am from San Diego California. I graduated from San Diego State University back in 2021. The degree I went for at the time was psychology. During the year that I graduated, I looked for many jobs in areas such as behaviorism. Unfortunatley, after further researching the field I wanted to get into, I realized that psychology wasn't for me. However, before researching for a career I needed to get out of my old job and so I stumbled upon substitute teaching. 
</p>

<p>Currentlty, I am a substitute teacher for Sweetwater Union High School District. My daily duties consist of subbing for teachers who need to take the day off around the school district. When I arrive at the job site i'm sent to, I look for instructions that the teacher left for me and I give the students thier tasks. Moreover, I mostly try and get classes with special ed kids. The reason why I like working with these teenagers better is because they listen more and actually do thier work without having to tell them more than five times. The skills i've aquired in this job is mostly working with coleagues to better suit the students needs. Lastly, another skill aquired has been fixing and understanding technology such as wifi and websites that students need.</p>

<p>Finally, the career path that I am aiming to break into is software development. What I am doing about this career change is taking The Complete 2023 Webdevelopment Bootcamp course on Udemy to learn the entry level coding requirements for jobs. My goal is to become a jr software fullstack developer by the beggining of 2024. I have been building a few projects here and there. Furthermore, I am creating a website for companies to see and interact with my projects.</p>
